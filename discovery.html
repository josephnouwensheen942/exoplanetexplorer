<h1>Methods of discovery of exoplanets</h1>
<h2>How to locate exoplanets</h2>
<p>Planets that orbit stars outside of our solar system are known as exoplanets. Scientists find them using a variety of methods. Here are the primary techniques, each with a brief explanation:</p>
<h3>Transit Method</h3>
<p>Methodology: This is the most widely used method for exoplanet discovery. A planet partially covers the light of its star when it moves in front of it, as seen from Earth. Telescopes can detect the tiny darkening that results from this.
An illustration would be if someone were to step in front of a light bulb; you would notice a brief dimming of the light.
</p>
<h3>Radial Velocity Method</h3>
<p>Methodology: The gravitational pull of a planet causes a star to wobble slightly as the planet orbits it. We can measure how this wobbling affects the star's light's wavelength and color.
Consider a ball attached to a string being swung in a circle, causing the ball and your hand to move simultaneously. The planet's gravity causes the star to wobble similarly.
</p>
<h3>Direct Imaging</h3>
<p>Methodology: With this technique, large telescopes are used to directly photograph the exoplanet. But it's quite difficult to spot the planet because stars are far brighter than planets.
As an illustration, consider attempting to identify a tiny firefly next to a strong spotlight.
</p>
<h3>Gravitational Microlensing</h3>
<p>Methodology: When a planet passes in front of a distant star, the planetâ€™s gravity can bend and amplify the star's light like a lens. It indicates to scientists that a planet exists.
Consider it analogous to bending light with a magnifying glass to view objects more clearly.
</p>
<h3>Astrometry</h3>
<p>Methodology: This method, like the radial velocity method, searches for minute changes in a star's position brought on by an orbiting planet's gravitational attraction.
For instance, you may tell something is pulling a tree if you see it sway slightly in the wind. Planets and stars operate in a similar manner.
</p>
<h3>In Short</h3>
<p><li>Transit Method: Seek for minute decreases in a star's luminosity.</li>
<li>Radial velocity measures the wobbling of a star caused by the influence of a planet.</li>
<li>Direct Imaging: Produces real images of the Earth.
Utilizes the light bending brought about by a planet's gravity for gravitational microlensing.</li>
<li>Astrometry: Tracks minute variations in a star's location.
The search for planets outside of our solar system is fascinating and full of possibilities because these techniques aid astronomers in finding and studying far-off worlds!</li>
